		My name is Mrs. Thomas! I am 25 years old and I have been an educator in the Muhlenberg District for 3 years. In my past time, I love to read, drink coffee, thrift, and spend time with my loved ones. I also have 2 dogs named Hank and Dolly that I love to cuddle on the couch with!

		It has been my end goal to retire as a school librarian. I believe that reading is one of the most important things a person can learn to do and learn to love. I truly believe that if someone doesn't like to read, they just haven't found the right book yet! Reach out to me via my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> section and I would love to recommend your next read!
